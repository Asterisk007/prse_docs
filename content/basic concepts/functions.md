Functions in PRSE are defined as follows:
```cpp
function <name>(<comma separated list of parameters>): <type> {}
```

The name of your function may be any identifier that has not been previously used. `main`
is reserved for the main function of the program. Any libraries you include that define
their own functions reserve the names of said functions.
